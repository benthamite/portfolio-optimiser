# Portfolio Optimiser

A portfolio optimisation tool using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). Unlike other calculators, this tool allows the user to override historical values and enter their own parameter estimates when they expect these to differ from past performance.

## Features

- Input asset tickers to fetch historical data.
- Calculate expected return, standard deviation, and correlation matrix.
- Display the efficient frontier with the max Sharpe ratio portfolio.
- Download the efficient frontier data as a CSV.
- Editable start dates for historical data.
- Display and edit asset returns, volatility, and correlation matrix.

## Usage

1. Enter asset tickers separated by commas.
2. Adjust the start date for historical data.
3. View and edit asset expected return, standard deviation, and correlation matrix.
4. View the efficient frontier plot.
5. Optionally, download the data as a CSV.

## Parameters

- **Expected Return**: The expected annual return of the asset.
- **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation of the asset's returns. For example, an asset with a return of 0.10 and a standard deviation of 0.08 will yield returns between 0.02 and 0.18 (0.10 ± 0.08) in two out of three years, and between -0.04 and 0.26 (0.10 ± (0.08 × 2)) in 19 out of 20 years.
- **Correlation Matrix**: A table showing the correlation coefficients between the assets, indicating how they move in relation to each other.
- **Risk-Free Rate**: The rate of return of short-term Treasury securities. Use to compute the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return (calculated as the expected return minus the risk-free rate, divided by the standard deviation).
